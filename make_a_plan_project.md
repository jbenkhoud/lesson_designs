# Make A Plan Project

## Overview

This project introduces students to the complexities of planning and teaches them to take past success rate and compounding probabilities into account. It is designed as a culminating project after the student has been introduced to bias, planning, and historical inquiry, and has had some experience handling complex abstraction. In the project, the student decides what they would like to plan (a business, a social change, a near-term activity e.g. attending college etc.) by goal-factoring different options and drafts a detailed, step by step plan to acheive that end. For each step, they must consider the historical precedent for that action being possible, as well as the resources required. Once they have a viable plan, they must estimate the probablities at all the stages along the way and decide if their plan is ultimately likely to succeed or not. 

Note: This project is very much an introduction to planning and designed to make students realize that planning is more complicated than they usually assume. It is important to explain that this method of planning is not always appropriate and that a large point of Bayesian estimation is to think through all the factors, rather than to accept the calculated result. 

## Relevant Outcomes

Students will familiarize themselves with probablitistic calculation.

Students will learn to recognize the way in which plans with many steps are not just harder, but rather that the difficulty is compounded at each step. 

Students will solidify their understanding of the utility of goal-factoring and goal-setting.

Students will practice reserach skills.

Students will practice effective estimation.

Students will practice communicating effectively.
