# Make A Plan Project

## Overview

This project introduces students to the complexities of planning and teaches them to take past success rate and compounding probabilities into account. It is designed as a culminating project after the student has been introduced to bias, planning, and historical inquiry, and has had some experience handling complex abstraction. In the project, the student decides what they would like to plan (a business, a social change, a near-term activity e.g. attending college etc.) by goal-factoring different options and drafts a detailed, step by step plan to achieve that end. For each step, they must consider the historical precedent for that action being possible, as well as the resources required. Once they have a viable plan, they must estimate the probabilities at all the stages along the way and decide if their plan is ultimately likely to succeed or not. 

Note: This project is very much an introduction to planning and designed to make students realize that planning is more complicated than they usually assume. It is important to explain that this method of planning is not always appropriate and that a large point of Bayesian estimation is to think through all the factors, rather than to accept the calculated result. 

## Teacher Notes
The purpose here is to teach students about the intricacies of complex plans, not provide a useful planning model that should be applied to every circumstance. One of my favorite quotes is, "One version of the process was to tally hypotheses and list out evidence, make up all the numbers, do the calculation, and then throw out the final answer and go with your brain's gut feeling after you'd forced it to really weigh everything. The trouble was that the items of evidence weren't conditionally independent, and there were multiple interacting background facts of interest..." (Eleizer Yudkowsky, http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/86). That is what the project is all about. Most students have never really tried to apply probabilities to decision making at all; the point is to make them get an intuitive sense of the difference between compounding circumstances and isolated ones. 

## Relevant Outcomes

Students will familiarize themselves with probabilistic calculation.

Students will learn to recognize the way in which plans with many steps are not just harder, but rather that the difficulty is compounded at each step. 

Students will solidify their understanding of the utility of goal-factoring and goal-setting.

Students will practice research skills.

Students will practice effective estimation.

Students will practice communicating effectively.

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Give the student the project description (see downloadable materials) and review it with them in detail. 
2. Have them follow that and help them along the way. *I usually do the initial goal-factoring with them.*

I'm including the process from that document here, as that is essentially the step-by-step guide.

1. Think about something you’d like to change about the world. It can be anything from wanting to open a store to wanting to solve world hunger, but it must be something concrete you can change and measure the results of. 

2. Once you’ve decided, goal factor that choice on the attached “Goal Factoring” sheet. If you forget what this is, ask me. 

3. Verify that you still want to stick with that choice. If not, goal factor your new choice (you can just recreate the chart on separate paper). Repeat until you’ve decided. 

4. If we haven’t discussed it already, email me your chosen change. 

5. Research the ways in which your change is already being approached in the world. For example, if you were trying to eliminate starvation, you’d look into what companies and individuals are already trying and what they’re doing. As you research, record what you find on the “Initial Research” sheet attached. You must provide four explanations of the methods being used already or prove to me that there aren’t at least four being tried. 

6. Analyze the four ways you unearthed in a couple of sentences or bullet points each on the attached “Initial Research” sheet. Tell me what you think would work well or not work well about them and why. 

7. Decide if you’re satisfied with any of the existing plans. If so (and you would change nothing), detail out that plan out on the “My Plan” sheet as described in Step 8. If you’re not satisfied, come up with your own plan and detail it on the “My Plan” sheet as described in Step 8.

8. Fill out the center and left columns of the “My Plan” sheet by listing the steps to your plan in the center column. In the left column, for each step of the plan, explain why you think that will work. You must include at least 2 historical examples (precedent) that back you up. For example, if step one of your plan is “gather smart people to think about what to do”, your left column would provide at least two examples of when getting smart people together worked out well. 

9. Share your sheet with me and discuss it with me if at all possible. For most of you, this will be the end of the first week of work on your project and we’ll meet before you proceed.

10. Fill in the right column of the “My Plan” sheet to analyze the likelihood of success for your plan. To do this, gather as much data as you can about how well your step has worked in the past. Don’t be biased here! Don’t just look for times it worked to back you up; try to get an actual sense of its success rate. 

  * For example, if the step is “gather the smart people” again, see if you can find any direct statistics on how often “gathering the smart people” works. If not, find as many (at least 10 examples for this project but for reality we’d be talking hundreds) examples of “gathering smart people to solve problems” happening as you can and figure out the success rate. 1/10? 5/10? 9/10? Cite a source (or many) for your data, and put the initial probability you uncover in the box. Then, if you find you need a boost (your results gave you 1/10 or something), explain what you could do to up that probability, why you think it would help (historical or statistical reasoning would be best, but at least a logical explanation) and what your predicted probability would be then. 

  **Do that for all the steps in your plan.**

11. Fill in the “Totals” row on your “My Plan” sheet. For the left column, you’re going to be explaining the summary version of the historical background that leads you to believe your overall plan will be a success. In the center column, you’re going to be presenting the summary version of your plan. In the right column, you’re going to be approximating the total probability by multiplying the probabilities of each step together. We’ll talk about this in class. 

12. Write or record your reflections on what you learned in the process of completing this project. What surprised you? Were you frustrated? Why? What could you take away and use from this experience?

13. Turn your “My Plan” totals columns into a presentation you can give in 3-10 minutes.   

14. Record any additional sources on the “Additional References” sheet. 

15. Present your final project on the final day of class when asked.

16. Turn in EVERYTHING and rejoice because the class is over!! Congratulations!!
