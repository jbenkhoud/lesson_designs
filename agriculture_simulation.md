# Agricultural Revolution Simulation

## Overview

This lesson introduces students to the social outcomes of the Agricultural Revolution. It is designed to follow some introduction to what the Agricultural Revolution was, but there's no need to explain the social outcomes in advance (in fact, it's better if you don't!). In the simulation, students will act as farmers and work competitively to maximize their personal outcomes while ensuring the entire group surivives the winter. The game is played in rounds and is followed by a reflection. I also follow that up with a written assessment, but that's up to you. 

Note: This lesson can be done with varying numbers of students, but is deisgned for groups of 3, 4, or 5. If you plan to use a different number, you'll need to edit the templates.

## Relevant Outcomes
Students will be able to explain how the conditions of the Agricultural Revolution led to the social hierarchy structure which dominated history for several thousand years afterwards.

Students will practice being able to extrapolate patterns in cause and effect from experience.

Students will practice communicating effectively and competing in a constructive manner.
