# Agricultural Revolution Simulation

## Overview
This lesson introduces students to the social outcomes of the Agricultural Revolution. It is designed to follow some introduction to what the Agricultural Revolution was, but there's no need to explain the social outcomes in advance (in fact, it's better if you don't!). In the simulation, students will act as farmers and work competitively to maximize their personal outcomes while ensuring the entire group surivives the winter. The game is played in rounds and is followed by a reflection. I also follow that up with a written assessment, but that's up to you. 

Note: This lesson can be done with varying numbers of students, but is deisgned for groups of 3, 4, or 5. If you plan to use a different number, you'll need to edit the templates.

## Relevant Outcomes
Students will be able to explain how the conditions of the Agricultural Revolution led to the social hierarchy structure which dominated history for several thousand years afterwards.

Students will practice being able to extrapolate patterns in cause and effect from experience.

Students will practice communicating effectively and competing in a constructive manner.

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. First, read all the instructions yourself and gather up the materials you're going to need!
### Before students arrive:
1. Set up the room:
  * Designate a "harvest" area and set up piles of the five different kinds of tokens that are separate from one another.
  * On a whiteboard, list each participant's or group's name with room for tallying their score.
  * Post a copy of the sign with the requirements for winter and total points per round visibly
  * Include a key showing which kinds of tokens you'll be using for which products on that requirements sheet.

2. Equip all student areas (which should be in line of sight of the sign with the winter requirements) with:
  * White board with “totals” area, “harvest chart” and “planting chart”. The charts are just "T" charts with the list of farmable items you're including in the left column and nothing in the right. This will be where they record how many of those items they plant and harvest each round.
  * Marker
  * Tissue or eraser
  * Cost chart (printable)
### Once students arrive:
1. Explain the very basic rules: 
  * No biting, pushing, shoving, running!
  * No extra time
  * NO TALKING except when allowed (important for this game specifically, not because I'm a stickler!)
2. Establish a procedure (or reference one you already use) for abruptly stopping an activity when time's up. (I just have them riase their hand to the sound of a timer and stop talking immediately).
3. Practice the procedure if necessary.
4. Explain how the game works (it's complex, so go slowly and check for understanding):
  * Each student is going to be a farmer. 
  * There will be six main phases of the game:
    * Planting: 
      * 30 seconds to choose what to plant
      * No talking
      * Can plant whatever you want, but only have x planting points
      * Planting costs the number of points it says in your chart
      * Everyone’s chart is different
      * Write down what you’ve chosen to plant on your whiteboard in the correct column
    * Reaping:
      * Students show others what they planted silently (reveal whiteboards)
      * Think about your plan for the harvest while teacher sets up harvest
    * Harvest:
      * 30 seconds to acquire resources from the pool (set up by teacher)
      * You may talk
      * At end, return to your seat and be silent
    * Winter:
      * Tally what you got during the harvest and record it in the correct chart on your whiteboard.
      * Determine your surplus (if any) by subtracting the amount you need of an item to survive from the total you have. 
      * Write an “X” if you died (you didn’t have everything required), a check mark if you survived with no surplus (no extra), and a smiley face if you survived with surplus (extra) in the “totals” corner
    * Cash-Out: 
      * Flip your whiteboard so everyone can see
      * Take turns saying what you got 
      * Trade in your surplus for prize points on your turn (every extra item you have counts as one point towards a prize)
    * Feast:
      * Think for 30 seconds about what happened silently
      * Talk for 30 seconds to prepare for round 2
      * Once all phases are complete, the game will begin again
      * In order for anyone to count their surplus towards prizes, everyone must survive the winter. If anyone dies, you all lost that round.
      * The person with the most points gets 1.25 points per surplus item instead of 1
      * Anyone who gets to 15 prize points will get a prize next class
 5. Ask if anyone has questions and review any areas of confusion.
 6. Play the game as outlined above in rounds 2-4 times until students understand and begin doing something consistent.
   *Essentially, you should expect them to specialize during planting given the different costs of production for each student, and most groups also establish a procedure for harvest in which everyone shares. However, given that no one knows how many rounds there will be, people usually also begin stealing excess crops. Sometimes, a student will be advanced enough to realize that rushing and taking the entire haul and then dividing as a "benevolent dictator", which is actually pretty ideal for the proving the point.*
7. Once students have established a norm, change rules to model the gains that can be acheived by controlling your own products by giving bonus points if you have the most of whatever you produced most that round.
8. Play one round in which you warn that them that, beginning the next round, your distance to the harvest will be dependent on the points you have. 
  *This usually leads to an aggressive, rule-breaking round, so be prepared!*
9. Finally, switch to playing rounds in which the number of points you have determine your starting distance from the harvest table to reflect the power that comes from having already acquired resources. 
  *Here you'll see how whichever student started in the lead begins to widen the gap and all other students fall desperately behind, modeling the early Agricultural Revolution and the way in which consolidated resource control led to huge amounts of power*
10. Once all rounds are complete and you've pretty much established monarchichal power, stop the game and tally the points.
11. As a class, discuss what strategies were affected and how you wound up with the power structure you did. If necessary, guide the discussion. The main takeaway should be that early agricultural leaders rose to power by either benevolently or malevolently controlling and distributing the food source and that once that control was established it was very hard to undermine. Even with everyone else working together to bring that individual down, the fact that they had so much control over resources made that nearly impossible.
12. Discuss with the class what other things could have further promoted that power structure (militaries designed to "protect the food" that are loyal only to a single ruler and kept by getting more resources; religious authorities which taught people to defer to authority rather than investigate phenomena directly, merchants and specialist non-farmers who were incentivized to make sure someone was controlling the food supply since they were not direct producers, etc.)
13. At your discretion, assign a follow-up assignment asking students to somehow demonstrate their understanding (I used a short essay).
14. Announce who has won a prize.
15. The End.

## Things to Gather
1. Five kinds of tokens (you'll need a lot of each; I use pennies and game tokens from a lot of different games)
2. A whiteboard for prize points (scoring)
3. A sign with the requirements for winter and total points per round posted visibly
4. A key showing which kinds of tokens you'll be using for which products
5. One per student of the following:
  *  One White board with “totals” area, “harvest chart” and “planting chart”
  *  Marker
  *  Tissue or eraser
  *  Cost chart (printable)
