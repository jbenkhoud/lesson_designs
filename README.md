#Greek Government Simulation

##Overview

This lesson is designed to teach students about the advantages and disadvantages of the four major forms of Greek government (monarchy, oligarchy, tyrrany, and democracy) by immersing them in a simulation of life under the different conditions. The class will be divided in half and required to build a kingdom using game tiles. Each round, the government structure will change, thereby changing the rules and procedures for how students can build their kingdom. After each round, the kingdoms will be scored and one "city-state" will win. In addition, students will be attempting to maximize personal points that are awarded for contributing game tiles to their city-state's gameboard. Only students in the winning "city-state" will be able to score their points that round. Students will later be able to turn in their personal points for prizes. 

At the end of each round, students reflect in a class discussion on the challenges and strengths of that round. Once all four rounds are complete, students guide a lesson in which they describe and evaluate the various forms of government. At the end of the two-day lesson, there is a quiz to assess learning outcomes. 

##Relevant Outcomes

Students will practice drawing on experience to develop a more systematic understanding of abstract life-related concepts.
