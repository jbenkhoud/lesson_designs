# Simulations
## [Greek Government Simulation](greek_government_simulation.md)
This lesson introduces students to the nuances of four types of government structure and their effects on citizens living within them. 

I originally used this for sixth-grade history, but it would work well in any class which deals with governmental structures (with some adjustments). 

## [Agricultural Revolution Simulation](agriculture_simulation.md)
This lesson is designed to help students learn how social hierarchy was developed and enforced as a result of the Agricultural Revolution. Students participate in a simple "farming" game in which they have to ensure all students survive the winter while maximizing personal gain. 

I intended this lesson for use in a tenth-grade World History course, but it would fit well in any class where the Agricultural Revolution was relevant.

## World War Three Simulation
The point of this lesson is to make students understand the complexity of global warfare, especially the utility and risks of non-combat tactics (research, propoganda, social engineering, etc.). Each student is assigned a modern region or country to represent and given very limited guidance about what actions they can take before they are thrown into a world war with the other students. The teacher uses a combination of spreadsheet formulas and personal judgement to weigh the outcomes of student actions until a victor is proclaimed. This is followed by a discussion and reflection on the various tactics attempted. 

I've used this in tenth-grade World History, but it could be adapted to other classes with some effort. I wouldn't recommend it for elementary-age students (because of content and organizational constraints).

# Projects
## [Constitution Project](constitution_project.md)

The purpose of this project is to help students gain a better understanding of the role and complexity of governance by forcing them to attempt to structure a government themselves. Rather than focusing on format or reserach upfront, however, this project has students begin by formulating a list of everything they feel governments should be responsible for and working backwards to engineer a structure that could accomplish those goals. Note that the emphasis here is not on the final product (no students will have anything close to perfect governments), but rather on the process of investigation and analysis students employ.

This project is best suited to twelfth grade Government students because it is easier to complete with content knowledge from earlier classes, but could be supported in other grades with additional resources and instruction.

## Government Speech Project

This lesson requires students to connect any Consituttional issue to current events and present a compelling spoken argument. It is designed to teach students to consider the audience of their work and investigate a complex problem independently.

I have only used this lesson for twelfth grade Government students, but it could be adjusted for any grade easily.

## Economics of Climate Solutions Project

This project centers around the investigation and evaluation of various climate change solutions. Students work to research and analyze the economic impacts of different ways of reducing climate damage. The finished product is a recommendation on which options would make the most sense and how to mitigate risks.

This project works best in a twelfth-grade Economics class, but could also be a great cross-curricular concept for interdisciplinary collaboration!

## Local New Deal Project

This project requires students to propose a "new deal" for their local economy that is economically viable and socially impactful. They begin by thinking about what kind of positive impact is most important to them and then delve into how to support that idea economically. After conducting research and evaluation, they draft a proposal for local companies or government that they ultimately submit to those agencies. 

I use this project for eleventh-grade U.S. History, but any time the New Deal comes up would work, too.

## [Make a Plan Project](make_a_plan_project.md)

This project's purpose is to introduce students to a more effective and detailed way to plan large-scale implementation. Students choose a product or idea and have to go from an original description to a viable plan for success, evaluating precedent, costs, and probability along the way. It's complicated and requires a lot of ad-hoc guidance, but it's pretty effective at helping students become familiar with end-to-end planning.

I use this project as a final for my World History students, but it is not at all subject-specific.
