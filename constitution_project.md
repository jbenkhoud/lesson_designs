# Constitution Project

## Overview

This project familiarizes students with the complexities and purpose of governments. Students work to design their own governments by establishing goals, researching, engineering, reflecting, iterating, and sharing their work. The process is largely independent, but guided frequently by teacher comments and discussion. The emphasis of this project is on the process, not the results, so please don't expect perfect governments! If students could make those, they should be running for office, not taking classes!

## Teacher Notes
The project will require students to backwards engineer a government, forcing them to confront the challenges of distributed power structures and competing incentives. The process is designed to make students internalize the true complexity of governance, and to think about the practical reality of the outcomes of government decisions. Most students who complete the project say that the most important thing they learned was that governments are real and messy, and that they're frighteningly vulnerable to cultural resourcing issues and latency. 

In addition, most students engage much more deeply with current events while working on this project as they start to see the problems they're trying to troubleshoot enacted by instututions like Congress or the Supreme Court. 

## Relevant Outcomes

Students will be able to explain the intricacies of governance and offer useful and constructive ideas for how governments could be improved.

Students will be familiar with the challenges of governance and will learn to recognize governmental decisions as interdependent and widely impactful. 

Students will learn to plan and complete projects over extended periods of time effectively, including how to revise and iterate on an idea once you have it.

Students will practice articulating their ideas effectively. 

## Step-by-Step Instructions
0. Before "beginning", make sure the student has accees to the project description/instructions (found under printable materials).
1. Begin by discussing with each student what the purpose of government is, inclduing how to evaluate whether or not the government is the most useful entity to accomplish various tasks, comparing against solutions that rely on other mechanisms. Ask them to compile a list of everything they feel it is important that a government accomplish in order to be successful. 
2. Once you have the list, ask the student to brainstorm as many ways as possible to accomplish each item in the list (e.g. "protect citizens from muderers: police, courts, prison, guns for every citizen, constant surveillance"). The purpose of this is not to put only good ideas down (constant surveillance is really not a good idea!), but rahter to force them to think about original and non-standard approaches to obvious problems. 
3. Discuss different ways of organizing a government with the student, beginning with asking them "who should be making decisions and controlling things?". Have a discussion about the merits and risks of locally, regionally, nationally, and individually controlled structures and try to get them to discuss most forms of government that they've heard of. 
4. Have the student conduct reserach on different kinds of government structures, providing them with some vocab to investigate if necessary (e.g. monarchy, parliamentary system, republic, fascism, socialism, etc.). Have them come back with an understanding and list of pros and cons for each format. 
5. Have the student return to their list of goals and possible ways of acheiving them and ask them to think about how that could be organized effectively. Provide as little guidance as possible, but enough to get them started. *Usually this means saying something like, "So you want everyone to have a free education and you think public schools are the best of your options for doing that. Who should be in charge of those? Should there be a President in charge of schools? Teachers? Parents? Should schools be the same everywhere or different? Maybe an education department?"*
6. Talk through some basic structures that might work for their government overall with them. For example, walk through what a departmental structure might look like vs a branch structure vs a direct democracy. Tell them to imagine what their government would look like in each form in more detail and come back with a decision and justification for which they want to go with. 
7. Have the student try to fit all of their goals into their chosen structure. Discuss briefly in person and provide guidance for areas of extreme confusion (for example, I often direct students who've chosen a departmental socialist structure to Sweden's website as a model for how they could start imagining a health-care system). *The level of detail I'd expect at this point is something like: Health Department in charge of making sure everyone has access to medical care, housing, and food. Run by three elected officials who appoint underlings at regional level. Regional level leaders are responsible for building necessary shelters, hospitals, etc. and hiring workers. Three high level leaders are elected by popular vote every 5 years, can be impeached by petition with over 50% population support.*
8. Play hardcore devil's advocate against their decision. Poke holes in their structure and point out places where they've left the door open to corruption or failed to account for something. *The most common issues are giving some small number of individuals too much power or forgetting to include a way to make enough money to cover their costs.*
9. Have the student try to address those things and get back to you. 
10. Repeat.
11. Once the student has a decent plan, have them formalize that plan into a rough draft of a "Constitution" for their nation. 
12. Help the student edit their "Constitution" by streamlining into sensible sections or fleshing out confusing peices.
13. Have students make final revisions.
14. Find other teachers, students, etc. to serve as an audience and have the student present their constitution for ratification.
15. Allow the audience to question the constitution.
16. If the student can defend and explain their constitution effectively enough to convince audience to ratify it, the project is complete. If not, the student must revise again until they are able to do so. 
17. Congratulate the student and celebrate; the project is stressful and difficult so it's important to highlight their accomplishment!
