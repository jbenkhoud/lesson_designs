# Constitution Project

## Overview

This project familiarizes students with the complexities and purpose of governments. Students work to design their own governments by establishing goals, researching, engineering, reflecting, iterating, and sharing their work. The process is largely independent, but guided frequently by teacher comments and discussion. The emphasis of this project is on the process, not the results, so please don't expect perfect governments! If students could make those, they should be running for office, not taking classes!
